      We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
      In a timeless land that is far out of reach

      Even the second, hour hands of the clock
      They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
      How I hope to have forever to spend
      This life, noâ€”all future lives
      Right here in this world with <a href="p6.html">you</a>
    </p>
