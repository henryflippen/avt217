      How I hated lifeless world
      That's made up entirely of dictionary word that
      I saw through my kaleidoscope
      On a monotonous August morn'

      When you appeared in front of me
      You acted shy but I didn't miss your grinning face like
      If it's the textbook of this world
      Of how to make your smile on your <a href="p8.html">face</a>
