    <h1>Story Start</h1>
    <p>
      Caught in a never-ending game
      Seems like the world's still trying to tame me
      If that's the way, I will obey
      Beautifully struggle every day

      Should we have a little kiss
      While seeing both of our hourglasses
      Let's make a plan to meet somewhere that is
      Most far from "goodbye"

      Finally, the time has come
      Everything up 'til yesterday was a prologue
      Skimming through the days of old
      It's my turn to bear the load
      My experience and my skill
      And all the courage I had let start to mildew
      At an unprecedented speed, I will
      Dive right into you

      And when I dozed off into a lukewarm can of soda, I
      Dreamed of a world so far from here that's not on the map
      Searching outside of the classroom window
      Or in a summer morning that's brought from the commuting train

      Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate"
      No matter how far they extend their hands
      We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
      In a timeless land that is far out of reach

      Even the second, hour hands of the clock
      They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
      How I hope to have forever to spend
      This life, no—all future lives
      Right here in this world with you

      Let's put away them far ahead
      "How do you do"s and all the "Nice to meet you"s
      And breathe over a thousand-year cycle in a single day

      How I hated lifeless world
      That's made up entirely of dictionary word that
      I saw through my kaleidoscope
      On a monotonous August morn'

      When you appeared in front of me
      You acted shy but I didn't miss your grinning face like
      If it's the textbook of this world
      Of how to make your smile on your face

      I've been looking for "incredible"s, the meaning of "unbelievable"
      I even hope for tragedies if it goes with the thrill
      But when you were standing in front of my door
      With every piece in your hand that I could ask for

      Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate"
      No matter how far they extend their hands
      Let's breathe, and dream, we'll play together in this place
      What do you say?

      Even the way that you loved
      I swear I could smell the scent of yours
      And in the way that you walked
      I could hear that bright laughter of yours

      Since one day you will disappear
      I'll keep every part of you
      Make sure that it's burned into the back of my eyes
      It's not a right that I'm due
      My duty that is must have been kept

      Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate"
      No matter how far they extend their hands
      We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
      In a timeless land that is far out of reach
      Even the second, hour hands of the clock
      They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
      How I hope to have forever to spend
      This life, no—all future lives
      Right here in this world with you
