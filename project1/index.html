    <h1>Story Start</h1>
    <p>
      <!-- page1 -->
      Caught in a never-ending game
      Seems like the world's still trying to tame me
      If that's the way, I will obey
      Beautifully struggle every day

      Should we have a little kiss
      While seeing both of our hourglasses
      Let's make a plan to meet somewhere that is
      Most far from "goodbye"

      <!-- page2 -->
      Finally, the time has come
      Everything up 'til yesterday was a prologue
      Skimming through the days of old
      It's my turn to bear the load
      My experience and my skill
      And all the courage I had let start to mildew
      At an unprecedented speed, I will
      Dive right into you

      <!-- page3 -->
      And when I dozed off into a lukewarm can of soda, I
      Dreamed of a world so far from here that's not on the map
      Searching outside of the classroom window
      Or in a summer morning that's brought from the commuting train

      <!-- page4 -->
      Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate"
      No matter how far they extend their hands
      <!-- page5 -->
      We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
      In a timeless land that is far out of reach

      Even the second, hour hands of the clock
      They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
      How I hope to have forever to spend
      This life, no—all future lives
      Right here in this world with you

      <!-- page6 -->
      Let's put away them far ahead
      "How do you do"s and all the "Nice to meet you"s
      And breathe over a thousand-year cycle in a single day

      <!-- page7 -->
      How I hated lifeless world
      That's made up entirely of dictionary word that
      I saw through my kaleidoscope
      On a monotonous August morn'

      When you appeared in front of me
      You acted shy but I didn't miss your grinning face like
      If it's the textbook of this world
      Of how to make your smile on your face

      <!-- page8 -->
      I've been looking for "incredible"s, the meaning of "unbelievable"
      I even hope for tragedies if it goes with the thrill
      But when you were standing in front of my door
      With every piece in your hand that I could ask for

      <!-- page4 -->
      Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate"
      No matter how far they extend their hands
      <!-- page9 -->
      Let's breathe, and dream, we'll play together in this place
      What do you say?

      Even the way that you loved
      I swear I could smell the scent of yours
      And in the way that you walked
      I could hear that bright laughter of yours

      <!-- page10 -->
      Since one day you will disappear
      I'll keep every part of you
      Make sure that it's burned into the back of my eyes
      It's not a right that I'm due
      My duty that is must have been kept

      <!-- page4 -->
      Words like "tomorrow" or "future" or "fate"
      No matter how far they extend their hands
      <!-- page5 -->
      We breathe, we dream, we raise our love
      In a timeless land that is far out of reach
      Even the second, hour hands of the clock
      They look at us sideways as they tick and tock
      How I hope to have forever to spend
      This life, no—all future lives
      Right here in this world with you
