          The Nellie, a cruising yawl, swung to her anchor without a utter of the sails, and was at rest. The ood had made, the wind was nearly calm, and being bound down the river, the only thing for it was to come to and wait for the turn of the tide. <br> The sea-reach of the Thames stretched before us like the beginning of an interminable waterway. In the ong the sea and the sky were welded together without a joint, and
          in the luminous space the tanned sails of the barges drifting up with the tide seemed to
          stand still in red clusters of canvas sharply peaked, with gleams of varnished sprits. A
          haze rested on the low shores that ran out to sea in vanishing atness. The air was dark
          above Gravesend, and farther back still seemed condensed into a mournful gloom,
          brooding motionless over the biggest, and the greatest, town on earth.<br>
          The Director of Companies was our captain and our host. We four aectionately
          watched his back as he stood in the bows looking to seaward. On the whole river there
          was nothing that looked half so nautical. He resembled a pilot, which to a seaman is
          trustworthiness personied. It was dicult to realize his work was not out there in the
          luminous estuary, but behind him, within the brooding gloom.
